# Making & Hosting an API from Scratch
A review covering creating an REST API with Express and Heroku.

## Heroku Setup

### What's Heroku again?
Heroku is just a platform that can host our server code, meaning code that can actively listen for requests (GET, POST etc) and respond 24/7 from any internet-connected device. As of 2020 Heroku is a good choice as it offers a free option, with the major drawback being the somewhat slow response times. We can create full-stack projects that live 100% on Heroku, or create a backend API on Heroku with our frontend living completely seperately on a seperate platform like GitHub pages.
